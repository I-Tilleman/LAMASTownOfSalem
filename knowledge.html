        <h1>Model</h1>
        <h2>Formal Model of the Game</h2>
        <p>The formal model of the game is defined as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The set of agents <i>A</i>, where <i>A = {A1, A2, A3, A4, A5}</i></li>
          <li>The set of roles <i>R</i>, where <i>R = {LO, Vet, Doc, GF, May}</i></li>
          <li>The set of nights <i>N</i>, where <i>N = {1, 2, .., 30}</i></li>
          <li>The Kripke structure &#x1D544; for the game Town of Salem. &#x1D544; is a tuple
            <i>⟨S, &#x03C0;, R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>4</sub>, R<sub>5</sub>⟩ where:</i></li>
            <ul>
              <li><i>S is a non-empty set of worlds.s</i></li>
              <li>&#x03C0; is the truth assignment to the propositional atoms per state; &#x03C0;: <i>S &rarr; (<b>P</b> &rarr; {T,F}).</i></li>
              <li><i>R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>4</sub>, and R<sub>5</sub></i> are the accessibility relations for every agent <i>a &isin; A</i></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Knowledge</h2>
        <p>Agents can obtain 4 different facts about agents and their actions. The first
          type of fact is about the role of an agent. The second and third type of fact are about the behaviour of the agents and the fourth type of fact is about an agent
          being killed. Each fact will be discussed in more detail below.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The first type of fact is about the role an agent has. It is represented in the following way: <i>Ax_role</i>, e.g. <i>A1_LOO</i> means that agent <i>A1</i> has the 'lookout' role. </li>
          <li>The second type of fact is about an agent visiting another agent. Only the lookout, the godfather and the doctor can visit other agents at night. Facts about agents visiting visiting other agents are represented in the following way: <i>AxV Ay_Nn</i> where <i>x &ne; y</i>, e.g. <i>A1V A3_N1</i> means that agent A1 visited A3 during night 1. </li>
          <li>The third type of fact is about the doctor healing someone. When the doctor heals an agent that was attacked, they receive a message stating that their target was attacked but that they saved them. The fact is represented in the following way: <i>AxH Ay_Nn</i> where <i>x &ne; y</i> and <i>Ax_Doc.</i> For example, <i>A1H A3_N2</i> means that agent <i>A1</i> (who is the doctor) healed agent <i>A3</i> on night 2.</li>
          <li>The last fact is about an agent dying during the night. The fact is represented in the following way: <i>xD_Nn_role</i> where <i>x &ne; y</i>, e.g. <i>2D_N3_GFR</i> means that agent <i>A2</i> was killed by the godfather during night 3. Because only the godfather and the veteran can kill, <i>role</i> can only be <i>GFR</i> or <i>Vet</i>. </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Axioms</h2>
        <p>The axioms are the main way that the agents can infer and obtain knowledge.
          The axioms correspond to certain situations in the game where the agents can infer which roles other agents can or cannot have. There are 3 general axioms
          that every agent can use, 4 axioms that only the lookout can use and 1 axiom
          that only the doctor can use.</p>
