        <h2>Simplification</h2>
        <p>As explained earlier, the original game is played with 8-12 players and contains over 40 different roles. In order to prevent an exploding complexity, especially when modeling knowledge, we decided to simplify the game. We reduced the number of players to 5 and predefined the roles which are in the game. We also simplified the process of the game. We omitted the small discussion period which players have before the start of a game.</p>

        <h2>Formalizing the game</h2>
        <p>The first iteration contains 5 agents with 5 different roles. This means that at the start of the game, there are 5! = 120 kripke worlds in the model. Out of those 5 roles, 4 are town roles: the lookout, the doctor, the veteran and the escort. There is 1 mafia role: the godfather.</p>

            <p><b>The lookout</b> can go to someones house at night and see who visits them that night. The lookout will know which players visited the player but will not know the roles of the visiting players.</p>

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <p>During the night, players use their abilities. First thing during the day, any dead players roles are determined </p>
