        <p>In the results (link), we can see that using axioms has a positive effect on the win rate, going from 43% to 70%. We expect that the reason for this is that in a 1v1 situation, the mayor can deduct whether the opponent is the godfather and can thus vote it out and win. Without axioms, the mayor would not be able to perform this deduction. This means the town cannot vote the godfather out and would have to rely on the veteran to kill it, essentially relying on luck. </p>

        <p>We also find that mayor is a strong town role; if it is killed the win rate is 50/50. This is likely because if the mayor and left with the godfather, it knows the other player is the godfather. This means that the mayor always wins when it is 1v1, whereas other roles would likely lose. </p>

        <p>The lookout and veteran are considerably less strong. With their win rates being close to 2 to 1. The lookout has a lot of axioms, which can help it obtain a lot of information. The veteran does not have as much information, but it has a chance to kill the godfather. The downside of that, is that it can also kill the lookout and the doctor, which is counterproductive to the town. </p>

        <p>The doctor is quite weak. This is likely because it can heal the godfather when the veteran would otherwise have killed the godfather, making the town lose when it could have won. Thus, like the veteran, this role has the risk of being counterproductive. Unlike the lookout and the mayor, which is likely why those roles are stronger. </p>

        <p>Another reason for why the doctor dying first could lead to such a high win rate for the town could be that the lookout can gain a lot of information from the doctor being dead. If the doctor is dead, only one role can visit others, which means it is considerably easier to deduct which player is the godfather.</p>
