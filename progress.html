          <p>This page outlines our progress at the time of the first version deadline and will not be included in the final report.</p>

          <h2>Model</h2>
          <p>We currently have a mostly functional model with the simplifications outlined in <a href="/LAMASTownOfSalem/model.html">"Model"</a>, although it is simplified even more than described. Currently it does not contain any type of discussion or voting, it simply initiates the agents and goes through multiple nights of the game. It also prints the last will of deceased players but this knowledge is not stored in the agents' knowledge in any way. We will implement this later as we realize that the discussions and announcements in the shape of last wills are what make the game interesting with regards to knowledge modeling.</p>

          <p>Once we have a fully functioning model and once we have a better grasp of the knowledge modeling, we aim to reduce the simplifications of the game model.</p>

          <h2>Knowledge</h2>
          <p>We do not yet have a fully automatic way of generating the Kripke models as described in <a href="/LAMASTownOfSalem/knowledge.html">"Knowledge"</a>, but this is mainly due to the fact that we did not first try to implement the very simplified version we described. Initially, we also wanted to model agents' knowledge of the visits and actions each night. When we realiezd that this might be slightly beyond our abilities (for now!), we ran out of time to implement the simpler version.</p>

          <p>In the end, we do aim to attempt to implement a less simplified version of the knowledge models but only if we think it is within the scope of our abilities.</p>

          <h2>Rules</h2>
          <p>We came up with a couple of basic inference rules, as can be seen in <a href="/LAMASTownOfSalem/rules.html">"Rules"</a>, but we do not feel like we have listed all possible ones yet. We also only listed inference rules that relate to the agent's knowledge of other agents' roles, not of their actions during the night.</p>

          <p>We do aim to extend this list if we come up with more possible inference rules, and we will definitely extend it if we do decide to model the actions of other agents.</p>

          <p>We also aim to make these inference rules more formal, but since we have not gotten aroudn to implementing them yet we have decided to stick with the intituive versions of the rules for now. Our final report will likely include both a formal version of the rules and a short intuitive explanation of each rule.</p>
